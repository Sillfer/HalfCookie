    Welcome to HalfCookie bakery!  This is your place for fresh gourmet cookies - baked to order for special delivery, pickup,  
    or shipment.  My lifelong love for cookies is the inspiration for this business and my unique recipes.  I began experimenting 
    with cookie dough recipes many years ago as an afternoon snack - i love baking cookies with depth of flavor, complexity and texture.  
    So, as you may imagine, cookies are the dessert of choice in my home.  The perfect thing about HalfCookie cookies is that they can be 
    enjoyed for breakfast, as a snack, or with coffee or tea.  Indulge anytime of day!  You too will love the treat!

    HalfCookie recipes are hand-mixed and baked in small batches.  
    You will find only the very best 100% natural ingredients in every delicious flavor - 
    no preservatives or artificial flavors - no trans fats.  The cocoa and chocolate is the same used by 
    the most admired Chefs and Pastry Chefs.  We use gourmet spice blends, select dried fruits and premium quality nuts.  
    All combined to create rich, deep, satisfying flavors.
